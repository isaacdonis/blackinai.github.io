As of 2021, Black founders in the US [receive](https://about.crunchbase.com/2020-diversity-spotlight-report/) around 2% of venture capital and Black investors [represent 3%](https://www.blckvc.com/) of the professionals in the Venture Capital industry. Through our entrepreneurship program, we aim to contribute to closing this gap by accelerating the success of Black in AI founders working on groundbreaking ventures. 

At Black In AI, we love to crunch the numbers as well as hear individual stories. Committed to mapping out our ecosystem and better understanding the needs of our community, we started our work in April of 2021 with an anonymous [survey](https://forms.gle/FP5UDayriEGaScPr6) for current and aspiring founders at Black in AI. We also had a followup [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EG8Y-iY-LPbdZfRMiwgRhW9SiG60zIaNXCTFoZ_JSr0/edit) for investors in the community.

After receiving an overwhelming number of positive responses (~150), we rolled up our sleeves and analyzed all companies with a black founder who is a Black In AI member across a range of specific criteria.
