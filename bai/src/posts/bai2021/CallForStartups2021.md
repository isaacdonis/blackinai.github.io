As you know, Black in AI [started](https://www.macfound.org/press/grantee-stories/strengthening-ai-diversity) with academic roots and has historically focused on breaking down the barriers for black researchers to fully participate in the development of artificial intelligence. Through our yearly workshop we gather the brightest black minds in the field to showcase their work. As part of this mission, we have also grown a community of 4000 members across 50 countries, built a social media presence to highlight year round the amazing work coming out of this community and established an award-winning [academic program](https://www.radicalai.org/black-in-ai-academic-program) to help members of the community apply to graduate school, postdocs and faculty positions. We intend to grow in this area and stay close to our academic roots.

Through working closely with members of the community and learning from their aspirations, we became aware of another area where we could play a bigger role: entrepreneurship. Many members here have started, are starting or will start technology companies based on recent advances in AI. The founder's journey comprises many highs and lows and we want to be here to support our entrepreneurs throughout their journey. As a step marking our desire to intentionally support these aspirations, we are excited to announce this year's workshop will include a startup showcase. 

We expect to showcase 40 startups from the community through a 1h digital event and have 30 min of networking activities.  If you identify as black and are the founder of an AI company, apply here by October 31st 2021 for an opportunity to showcase your startup. 

**If you are an ally and/or want to help with reviewing startups, apply [here](https://forms.gle/kFV1PeJJYKHPiUCBA) by October 31st 2021.**
