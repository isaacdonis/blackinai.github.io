We welcome research papers, position papers, survey papers, vision papers, or papers that inform about neglected/abandoned areas of study where AI could be impactful. Papers may introduce new theory, methodology, applications or product demonstrations. Papers are published in a non-archival format and may have been published in other venues before or be published in other venues in the future.

Submissions may include, but are not limited to, the following topics: Artificial Intelligence, Computational Neuroscience, Deep Learning, Knowledge Reasoning, Machine Learning, Multi-agent Systems, Statistical Reasoning, Computational Theory, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Data Mining and, Robotics. We also welcome papers about applications of AI to Health, Education, Fairness, Ethics and, Transparency in AI, AI & Arts, AI & Politics, etc.

Each submission will fall into one of these 4 tracks:
- Machine learning Algorithms
- Systems and Applications
- Position papers

Work may be previously published, completed, or ongoing. The workshop will not publish proceedings. We encourage all Black researchers in areas related to AI to submit their work. The work should include at least one Black researcher either as main author or co-author.
