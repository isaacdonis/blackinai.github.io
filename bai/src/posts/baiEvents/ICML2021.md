For over four years, Black in AI is a place for sharing ideas, fostering collaborations, and discussing initiatives to increase the presence of Black people in the field of Artificial Intelligence. If you are in AI and either self-identify as Black, African, Diaspora or an ally, please join us at ICML21 to discuss interests, challenges, opportunities, collaborations, and other related issues. We plan to gather for a one-hour town hall and Q&A session. We'll then continue with informal socializing for the remaining hour.
