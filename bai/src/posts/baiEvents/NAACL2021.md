## Social Program

- Speed Networking (Glimpse)
  
Glimpse is a speed networking platform, where you will have time to have a 1-on-1 conversation with someone who is also participating in our social. In addition to being fun, you can connect with several people in the community.

- Karaoke presentations (Ohyay)

Game time! In this game, we look forward to your engagement. We will have a slide deck with topics that will only be revealed on the spot, and each participant should present a quick talk about that topic as soon as it appears. No rehearsing, totally improvised on the spot. We will admire your creativity! 

- Open Discussion: **Is the diversity of African languages an advantage or a challenge in building an NLP model?** (Zoom)

To end our social, we will have 30 minutes of open discussion on this topic and we will have African panelists to foster our open debate. Join us! 
(Updates about our invited panelists soon.)
