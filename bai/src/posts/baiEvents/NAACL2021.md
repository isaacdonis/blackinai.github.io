## Social Program

- Speed Networking (Glimpse)
  
Glimpse is a speed networking platform, where you will have time to have a 1-on-1 conversation with someone who is also participating in our social. In addition to being fun, you can connect with several people in the community.

- Karaoke presentations (Ohyay)

Game time! In this game, we look forward to your engagement. We will have a slide deck with topics that will only be revealed on the spot, and each participant should present a quick talk about that topic as soon as it appears. No rehearsing, totally improvised on the spot. We will admire your creativity! 

- Open Discussion: **Is the diversity of African languages an advantage or a challenge in building an NLP model?** (Zoom)

To end our social, we will have 30 minutes of open discussion about African languages ​​in the NLP ecosystem and we will have African panelists to foster our open debate. Join us!
